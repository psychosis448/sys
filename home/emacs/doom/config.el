;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'modus-vivendi)

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type relative)

;; This globally displays a column indicator at column 80
(setq global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/")

;(setq projectile-project-search-path "$XDG_PROJECT_DIR")
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/prj/"))
